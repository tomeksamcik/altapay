# Technical Test

## Instructions

- Complete TODOs in the code as you see fit
- You may change all files in the project: design, method signature, packages, classes, etc. 
- Commit what you do in order to leave an audit trail
- There is no time limitation, but we encourage not spending more than an hour

Once the test is delivered, we will assess your work and we will call you in for a follow up interview.

## Next Interview

During the next interview we will take the chance to discuss your work and the design decisions that you have made.

We believe there is no right nor wrong without analysing trade-offs first.

We typically discuss IoC, DI, TDD among other topcis, and have a pair programming exercise at the end.
